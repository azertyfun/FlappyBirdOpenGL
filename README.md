Flappy bird OpenGL
==================

Flappy bird OpenGL is a personnal project of mine.
This was made for the challenge, not to fork and release the work of somebody else. It was just made for the challenge.

The sprites were found on [The Spriters Resource](http://www.spriters-resource.com/mobile_phone/flappybird/sheet/59537/), they are not mine (just doubled the size and change the "touch" to "Space" to fit desktop environnment).

This was coded using OpenGL 1.1 and LWJGL.

Recommended configuration :
---------------------------
If you see this through windows, you should have a good configuration XD
With my dekstop (AMD FX-6300 and Gigabyte nVidia GT 640 OC), it runs at about 30,000 - 40,000 FPS. Quite a lot ! x)
